### Full view

It's a combination of the 2 first pages

###Â Expression evaluator
As its name suggests, you can write a given expression ( A condition ) and the App will tell you if the condition is true or false according to your current variable

#### for example

`!#isFsOnly` returns `True` if the variable isFsOnly is `False` on your current profile.

This evaluator can handle even more complex conditions like `!(#isAh?:false) and !#isFsOnly and (#nomPack == 'PackPremium' or #nomPack == 'PackEssentiel' or #nomPack == 'PackExpert' or #nomPack == 'PackVisites') and !(#offreVerticalisationAutoAvailable?:false)`.
